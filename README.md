# Personal-Accounts
This is a beginner level Python project which uses a data base and is able to create and edit custom .xlsx worksheets. It can handle multiple users. Each user's files are password protected.
All the files and debpendencies are present.
I have also uploaded a database file and two .xlsx files for testing purposes.
Note that all the files should be in the same directory on runtime and the kivy package must be installed for GUI dependencies.
